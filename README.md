## Simple Investment Property Calculator

Something I've wanted for myself for a while now. Built with HTML and vanilla JavaScript with Bootstrap for some easy styling.

Allows for a simple calculation of potential cash flow from a prospective rental property given all the basic expenses that go into buying and managing a rental property.

The goal is to:

1) start out with a simple site that can make and report the estimated monthly cash flow and then
2) add on a second option to allow a user to calculate the breakeven purchase price given a desired monthly cash flow amount and
3) possibly also add a house flipping calculator to estimate potential revenue/profit from a flippig project.
